**Why this matters**: When drafting, the agent (or a delegated sub-agent) can load `experiment_log.md` alongside the LaTeX template and produce a first draft grounded in actual results. Without this bridge, the writing agent must parse raw JSON/CSV files and infer the story — a common source of hallucinated or misreported numbers.

**Git discipline**: Commit this log alongside the results it describes.
